# Smash Bros. Roster Maker

Access the roster maker at [benshoeman.github.io/Roster-Maker](benshoeman.github.io/Roster-Maker). Tested on Firefox and Chrome, but should work in any modern browser.

Ever wanted to make your ideal roster for Smash Bros. but the tools already out there don't really look like a roster for a Smash Bros. game? Look no further! I was disappointed that the only solutions I could find out there were usually Windows only and didn't really look like the source material.

Let me know if there are any issues running it!
